    "CS 2340 GT Movies Store": "The GT Movies Store website is a nifty way to browse a selection of (the best) movies. You have an About page (about the website), a Movies page (where you can find some of my favorite movies or movies that I just thought of), and a Cart page (where you can see what movies, if any, you've added to your cart). You can also Login (or Sign Up!) if you'd like your data to be saved. On my end, I'm able to have special admin privileges to manage the website, edit orders, view accounts, and more. This website allows you to review movies, edit and delete your own reviews, and report anyone's review, regardless of whether you have an account or not. \n\n Process Description: This was a pretty difficult project, since I am not an HTML pro! Even following the guide, I struggled, as I was constantly getting errors from weird spaces and indentations in the provided code. Debugging took most of my time! Ed Discussion, Stack Overflow, and GeeksforGeeks were great. I started early and spread out my work, which went well for me. My methodology was to just thoroughly check all my steps, try my best to understand what was going on, narrate my thoughts, and take moments to logically parse what I was doing.", "CS 1301 Lab03, Solar System": "Find out how much you would weigh and how old you would be considered if you relocated to one of the other planets in our Solar System!"
